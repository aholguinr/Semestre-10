*sdvun_gazebo* Package
######################

This package contains *launch* files, *world* files and params files for run
Gazebo, spawn LabFabEx world and SDVUN mobile robots and call required nodes for
Navigation Stack.

Contained *launch* files are:

- *sdvun_nav.launch*: Calls another *launch* files that runs Gazebo, spawn LabFabEx world and spawn an SDVUN with Navigation Stack.
- *sdvun_empty_world.launch*: Runs Gazebo in an empty world an spawns an SDVUN without Navigation Stack. Inteded for testing the SDVUN movements.
- *spawn_sdvun.launch*: Loads the SDVUN robot description and spawns it in Gazebo, without Navigation Stack nodes. Requires a running Gazebo world.
- *spawn_sdvun_nav.launch*: Loads the SDVUN robot description and spawns it in Gazebo, with Navigation Stack nodes. Requires a running Gazebo world (preferably a LabFabEx world).



sdvun_nav.launch
****************

This launch is intended to run a quick simulation of SDVUN in Gazebo, spawning 
the LabFabEx model and one SDVUN. Receives multiple arguments that allows you 
to configure some aspects of the simulation. These arguments are:

- rviz (true or false, Default false): If true, runs RViz configured to show the topics of runnnig SDVUN
- localization (amcl or hector. Default hector): Defines the LOcalization Component used by spawned SDVUN.
- robot_model (sdvun1, sdvun2 or sdvun3. Default sdvun1): Sets the model of SDVUN.
- namespace (Default ""): Namespace of all nodes and topics that belongs to Navigation Stack of the SDVUN. By default, no namespace is used.



sdvun_empty_world.launch
************************

This launch is intended to run a quick simulation of SDVUN in Gazebo, without 
any other object in the Gazebo world and without any of the Navigation Stack 
nodes. Its main purpose is allow to view the SDVUN in Gazebo, test its movements 
and check if the SDVUN Visual Model spawns correctly in Gazebo.

Arguments used in this launch file are:

- robot_model (sdvun1, sdvun2 or sdvun3. Default sdvun1): Sets the model of SDVUN.
- joypad (true or false. Default false): If true, launch a joy node that allows you to move the SDVUN using a joypad. Requires *sdv_scripts* package.
- namespace (Default ""): Namespace of all nodes and topics that belongs to SDVUN. By default, no namespace is used.



spawn_sdvun.launch
******************

With this *launch* you can spawn an SDVUN in a running Gazebo simulation, without
a Navigation Stack nodes.

Arguments used in this launch file are:

- robot_model (sdvun1, sdvun2 or sdvun3. Default sdvun1): Sets the model of SDVUN.
- namespace (Default ""): Namespace of all nodes and topics that belongs to SDVUN. By default, no namespace is used.



spawn_sdvun_nav.launch
**********************

This *launch* file spawns a SDVUN in a running Gazebo simulation with Navigation 
Stack nodes. By default, uses *hector_mapping* as *Localization Component* an 
*sdvun1* as *robot_model*

Arguments used in this launch file are:


- localization (amcl or hector. Default hector): Defines the LOcalization Component used by spawned SDVUN.
- namespace (Default ""): Namespace of all nodes and topics that belongs to SDVUN. By default, no namespace is used.
- robot_model (sdvun1, sdvun2 or sdvun3. Default sdvun1): Sets the model of SDVUN.
