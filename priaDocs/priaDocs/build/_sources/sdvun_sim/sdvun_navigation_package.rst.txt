sdvun_navigation Package
########################

This package contains *launch* files and params files for run and configure 
required nodes of SDVUN Navigation Stack.

Contained *launch* files are:

- *amcl.launch*: Launch and configure the *AMCL* node. This node is used as *Localization Component* in Navigation Stack.
- *hector.launch*: Launch and configure the *Hector Mapping* node. This node is used as *Localization Component* in Navigation Stack.
- *move_base.launch*: Calls and configures the *move_base* node. This node makes multiple tasks like move robot base, path planning and apply robot recovery behaviors.


Navigation Stack: amcl, hector and move_base launch files
*********************************************************

SDVUN Navigation Stack is a set of nodes and topics that gives to the mobile 
robot the capability to drive itself, avoiding obstacles, planning paths and 
calculating its own pose in a LabFabEx map. More info in 
`ROS.org: Navigation <http://wiki.ros.org/navigation>`_

move_base
=========

The *move_base* node is the main node of Navigation Stack: controls the SDVUN 
sending *Twist* messages to controller, plans the best path and fix estimated 
pose. *move_base.launch* can call this node and configures it using *yaml* files
that contains all the required parameters. These configuration files are:

- move_base_params.yaml
- costmap_common_params.yaml
- global_costmap_params.yaml
- local_costmap_params.yaml
- base_local_planner_params.yaml
- eband_local_planner_params.yaml

*move_base* requires other nodes like a *Localization Component*, TF and a Scan 
Source (Laser Scans). This file is called by other launch files as 
*spawn_sdvun_nav.launch*.

hector_mapping
==============

*hector_mapping* is used in Navigation Stack as *Localization Component*. This 
node belongs to *hector_slam* metapackage. Its not a part of default ROS 
repositories and can be outdated or  not supported in current verisons of ROS.

This node is configured in *hector.launch* file. Parameters contained in this 
file are related with Scan topic, coordinated frames, map resolution and origin, 
and map update parameters.

*hector_mapping* builds a map while robot scans the enviroment (this is its main
purpose). This map is diferent from the *map_server*, that was built in a 
previus activity. 

This file is called by other launch files that inserts the Navigation Stack 
nodes.

amcl
====

Similarly to *hector_mapping*, *amcl* node is used in Navigation Stack as 
*Localization Component*. This node belongs to supported ROS packages and 
updates more frequently. AMCL (Adaptive Monte Carlo Localization) generates 
multiple probable poses of the robot, using sensor data like Laser Scans and IMU
messures. This node is not implemented in real SDVUN mobile robots, but in a 
future update, can be used (main objective of *sdvun_sim* is develop and test 
new software!).

This node is configured in *amcl.launch* file. Contains a lot of parameters 
related with probalistyc and error manage, laser options, map parameters, 
initial pose and others.

This file is called by other launch files that inserts the Navigation Stack 
nodes.
