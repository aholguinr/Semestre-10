Tutorial: Adding a new robot description
########################################

*Robot Description* is a file that contains all properties that models a robot 
and allows Gazebo simulate all physics involved in world simualtion.

Recomended properties and models are:

- Visual model: a set of meshes that represent the robot.
- Collission model: a set of meshes (or basic forms) used by Gazebo to solve collisions of robot with other .
- Inertial model: numeric values. Describes inertial, mass and center of mass of real robot (or ideal robot).
- Friction model: SDF tags that describes the friction properties of real robot.

In this tutorial, you'll see diferent steps taken in the develop of SDVUN3 robot 
description.
