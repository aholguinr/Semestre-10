Common Problems
===============

1. Build fails when run *catkin_make* in the workspace:

    If build fails, you have to verify if all required packages are installed.
    Also, you have to verify the ROS version: *sdvun_sim* was developed for ROS
    Melodic distro, and has not been tested in other versions

2. Some errors appear after run sdv_nav.launch command:

    A correct build of *sdvun_sim* don't generate errors in the terminal. If 
    you find an error (generally, text in red color), you can search in 
    internet copying the text. Most errors occurs because some missing package
    or configuration.

3. SDVUN robot don't moves after clicking the screen in RViz:

    Verify that all requiered nodes of Navigation Stack are running, through
    this command::

     rosnode list
    
    The list depends of localization node, if RViz is running and if you use 
    namespaces. The list may look like this:

    - /gazebo
    - /gazebo_gui
    - /hector_mapping
    - /map_server
    - /move_base
    - /odom_to_map_tf
    - /robot_pose_publisher
    - /robot_state_publisher
    - /rosapi
    - /rosbridge_websocket
    - /rosout

    A missing node in the list may be the reason of the fail.

    Other reason: RViz needs to be configured to read messages from topics. In 
    the *sdvun_rviz* package you'll find some .config files that you can use to 
    configure RViz. Go to *File > Open Config* and select any of the files 
    containded in *<workspace/src/sdvun_sim/sdvun_rviz/rviz>*.
