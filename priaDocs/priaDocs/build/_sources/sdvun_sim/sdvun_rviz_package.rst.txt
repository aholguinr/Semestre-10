*sdvun_rviz* Package
####################

This package contains *rviz* config files and *launch* files, intended to 
configure and use RViz with any SDVUN that runs ROS Navigation Stack.



Configuration files for RViz
****************************

RViz is a complete ROS-topic viewer that requires some configurations that allow 
us to use all topics that a running SDVUN simulation can generate. Its 
complicated and tedius make this settings every time that we launch RViz. For 
this reason, *sdvun_rviz* contains some general *rviz* config files that are 
called for some *launch* files of others packages and, also, you can use with an
independent RViz instance.

*rviz* files contained in this package are:

- sdvun_amcl.rviz
- sdvun_hector.rviz
- sdvun1_hector.rviz
- sdvun3_hector.rviz
- sdvun2_hector.rviz
- view_robot_description.rviz

Some rules to use any of these config files:

- All files that starts with *sdvun* prefix are used to view main topics of Navigation Stack. 
- If *sdvun* is followed by a number, this configuration file is intended to use when simulate sn SDVUN with namespace.
- Last word indicates the Localization Component used by Navigation Stack.

Finally, *view_robot_description.rviz* file is used by RViz to view any SDVUN model.

.. _view-model-rviz:

View Robot Model in RViz
************************

To see an specific SDVUN robot model, you can use a *launch* file that loads a 
robot description in ROS param an show loaded model::

 roslaunch sdvun_rviz view_robot_description.launch robot_model:=sdvun

You'll see something like picture below:
