Currently available collaborative robots, such as the Universal Robots UR5, are safe enough to be able to 
work alongside people without being fenced in. However their capabilities are still quite limited. We are 
working on the next generation of collaborative robots that will be smarter, safer and much more interactive 
with users. We have developed a collaborative robot arm, and C++ software for controlling it using sensor data. 
The arm is equipped with a variety of sensors, including RGB-D sensors that provide real-time image and depth data. 
The objective of this project is to design, program and experimentally test robot software for collaborative tasks. 
Of particular interest is the so-called “handoff” or “handover” task where the robot retrieves a desired object 
(e.g., a tool) and passes it to the person, or the person passes an object to the robot. This project will provide 
an opportunity to learn and apply 3D vision, kinematics, and control algorithms to a next generation collaborative 
robot. The software development will be in C++.

Project dates may be subject to change. Students must discuss any date limitations with the faculty supervisor. 
Final project dates are confirmed in March 2023.

Programming in C++. Some knowledge of robotics.

The student is expected to design, program and experimentally test software for controlling the robot arm. 
They will be working as a member of the robotics research team at McMaster University.
